# üåßÔ∏è Hydrological Simulation Dashboard

A web-based tool that simulates surface runoff based on rainfall, land use, and soil type using the SCS-Curve Number (CN) method. Designed for urban planners, civil engineers, environmental scientists, and educators who need a fast, interactive way to visualise flood risk and surface runoff.

## üìå Overview

The Hydrological Simulation Dashboard allows users to simulate surface runoff using simplified hydrological models. By adjusting rainfall and site parameters (such as land use and soil type), users can understand how different conditions impact runoff volumes and flood potential.

This tool is useful for:
- Rapid flood risk screening
- Educational demonstrations
- Urban development planning
- Environmental project assessments
